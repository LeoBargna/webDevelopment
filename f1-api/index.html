            F1 Stats is a website where you can see data
            about F1 races and drivers with a simple GUI. Data include the calendar and the standings
            of the current season, biographical information of current and former drivers and 
            their palmares, but also final standings of each race and qualifying session, including
            all the lap times and pit stops for a specific race.
            F1 Stats is currently work in progress, so more sections will be included in the next weeks;
            data accuracy, website design and efficiency will be improved, too.

            <p>The making of F1 Stats has been made possible by Ergast API (all the documentation is
                available at <a href="http://ergast.com/mrd">this link</a>. The Ergast Developer API 
                is an experimental web service which provides a historical record of motor racing data 
                for non-commercial purposes. It includes data about circuits, drivers, calendars, standings, 
                lap times, pit stops, constructors. It is important to note that some data, especially 
                the historical one, may be inaccurate or unavailable.
